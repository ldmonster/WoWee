## Usage

These HD BLP textures are ready for integration with:
- **WMO Renderer**: Building texture mapping
- **Character Renderer**: M2 model skin/face textures
- **Creature Renderer**: NPC texture application

## Integration Status

Textures are loaded via the BLP pipeline and applied to WMO/M2 renderers.
HD texture overrides (e.g. TurtleHD packs) can be placed as PNG files
alongside the original BLP paths — the asset manager checks for `.png`
overrides before loading the `.blp` version.
